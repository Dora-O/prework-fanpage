            BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010
            and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved
            to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on 
            the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and 
            individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an 
            alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.</p>
